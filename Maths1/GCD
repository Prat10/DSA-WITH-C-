Given two positive integers A and B, find GCD of A and B.


Example 1:

Input: A = 3, B = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3

solution:for O(min(A,B)) time complexity
int gcd(int A, int B) 
	{ 
	    // code here
	    int res=min(A,B); //it will get the min number from two it is a built-in funciton in c++
	    while(res>0){    //from this we check until zero which is greatest comman divisor
	        if(A%res==0 && B%res==0){
	            break;   //once we find the max we break the loop
	        }
	        res--;
	    }
	    return res;   //return the result
	      
	}
