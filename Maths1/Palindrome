Given an integer, check whether it is a palindrome or not.

Example 1:

Input: n = 55555
Output: Yes

Solution:
 	string is_palindrome(int n)
		{
		    int rem=0;
		    int n1=n;
		    int num;
		    // Code here.
		    while(n!=0){//121
		      num=n%10;                   //In this line we short the number by 1 digit each time 
		      rem=rem*10+num;             //we take a rem as variable from 0 to multiple with 10(every iteration) + num to get the number from back 
		      n=n/10;                     //we get new divisior to check again a while loop
		    }
		    if(rem==n1){
		        return "Yes";             //once rem == n1 which is a original number ,if both equals it print "Yes"
		    }
		    else return "No";
		}
