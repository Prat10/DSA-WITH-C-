question: Find all the divisors of N 


solution:in this the time complexity of 0(sqrt(n)) better with brute force which causes 0(n) time
and the auxillary space is 0(1)
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

void printDivisorsOptimal(int n){
    
    cout<<"The Divisors of "<<n<<" are:"<<endl;
	for(int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++)  //in this line the sqrt(n) is root where the loop stop and print all divisors and quotient which are exactly a divisor of number;
		if(n % i == 0){                
			cout << i << " ";
			if(i != n/i) cout << n/i << " ";
		}
	
	cout << "\n";
}

int main(){
	printDivisorsOptimal(36);
        return 0;
}
